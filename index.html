		   <h1>ESOL Facing Budget Shortfalls</h1>

		  	<p> When Rosa Janco, 20, arrived in the U.S. from Bolivia six months ago, she only spoke a few words of English - not much more than &quot;hello; and "goodbye."" The most difficult part about learning English, she said, is the pronunciation.</p>

<p>"Conversation is difficult for me because I listen, I read, I write. But when i want to speak, I can't,"" she said. </p>

<p> Since she began taking adult English language classes at Catholic Charities International Center, part of a larger nonprofit located in the financial district, her English has improved, and teachers have even started preparing her for job interviews. </p>

<p>But many immigrants in the city are waitlisted for free adult English courses like the one Catholic Charities offers. The New York Coalition for Adult Literacy estimates that at least 14,000 people have been waitlisted for English programs around the city. According to the coalition, the city has had influx of 365,000 immigrants since 2005. A decrease of $6 million in adult literacy programming in the 2016 city budget has eliminated an estimated 6,300 seats.</p>

<p>According to the New York Center for an Urban Future, the number of state-funded ESOL (English speakers of other languages) seats has decreased 32 percent from 2005 to 2013.</p>

<p>ESOL programs across the city have started requesting that the city increase ESOL funding, in anticipation of the 2017 city budget. The New York Coalition for Adult Literacy, and Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy organization, each published public "asks" for increased ESOL funding, requesting $16 and $17.2 million respectively. On March 28, New York City Council member Carlos Menchaca held the council’s first immigrant budget hearing, where many ESOL administrators testified in support of more funding.</p>

<p>Elaine Roberts, an ESOL teacher and the Director of Programs at Catholic Charities, said there are always people on a waiting list for day and night courses at the nonprofit. Many people are turned away, some because their work schedule conflicts with Catholic Charities' time commitments.</p>




<p>"We'd like to have you, but this person can come in ten hours a week,"" Roberts said, describing a conversation with someone waitlisted from her program. "We would probably give them priority."</p>

<p>Roberts said funding is unstable from year to year. A program they had through the city, called the Young Immigrant Literacy Program, was shut down last year when a contract was not renewed. She was told that this was due to a lack of city funds. The program, which was funded from July 1st 2014 through June 20, 2015, held 100 seats and now has none.</p>

<p>Catholic Charities International Center only has two ESOL teachers as full-time staff, Roberts said. They used to have three, but recently had to let a teacher go when their funding shrank.</p>

<p>The rest of their teaching staff are volunteers. One of their volunteer teachers, Mark Winter, said he also volunteers at ESOL programs in Bronx and Queens, and supports himself with pre-existing income.</p>




<p>Roberts said she has heard other programs are experiencing a high demand. The Riverside Language Program in the Bronx was has to hold a lottery to determine which students get ESOL slots, she said.</p>

<p>Diane Reynolds, the ESOL coordinator at Lehman college, estimates there are about 100 people on the waiting list for ESOL classes in the evening and about 60 for morning classes. Lehman's program, like most adult English programs across the city, rely on both state and city funds. They received some funding last year through the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but Reynolds said that many organizations have lost that funding.</p>

<p>Lehman's ESOL program has not decreased the amount of seats they provide because they are required to keep a state mandated average daily attendance. Their waitlist fluctuates year to year, Reynolds said, but she attributes a recent increase to word of mouth interest in their program and lack of funding for neighboring programs.</p>

<p>"If our numbers are any indication it must be the same all over,"" Reynolds said. “The students who want to better themselves and be here should have the opportunity to"</p>

<p>Donna Kelsh, Director of the Institute of Immigrant Concerns, a nonprofit that provides adult english language training as well as job-training. Two years ago the program was part of Mount Saint Vincent, but they incorporated as a nonprofit when Saint Vincent opted not to continue their funding.</p>

<p>Kelsh said that most ESOL funding goes to large organizations like the New York Public Library, but small organizations have more trouble getting public funds. "It's really hard for a small, community based organization to get funding. That's really the story,"" Kelsh said.</p>

<p>Kelsh said that more ESOL funding could not only increase the number of seats, it could lead to classes being offered in both the morning and evening, so that English learners with different schedules would be able to attend.</p>

<p>Kelsh, who has been an ESOL teacher for over 35 years, hopes that more funding is allocated for ESOL in the city's 2017 budget. But she is weary.</p>

<p>"There's never enough. This has been the story forever,"" Kelsh said.</p> </article>
